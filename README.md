EveApps is a set of applications based on Eve Series chip (FT80X, FT81X, BT815/6, BT817/8) for users to refer to.
It contains 28 demo application and 11 sample application. They are all written in ANSI C code and full source code is enclosed.

- Demo application is for demo purpose and fair complex, which is closed to real-life project. 
- Sample application is for the tutorial purpose which is simpler and easier to understand each display list or command.   

For beginners, please always start from SampleApp project at first.

All the applications here depend on a set of common files under "common" folder. 
Each application has one subfolder "project" which contains the project file used to build it up from toolchain.
For FT4222/MPSSE or Eve Emulator platform, the project file is for Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 IDE.
For FT90X/FT930 platform, the project is for Eclipse IDE from Bridgetek. 

Users are assumed to be familiar with the programming guide and data sheet of Eve Series chips. 

Please note that some of the applications are developed for certain Eve Series chips or host platforms (see ["Support platforms"](#support-platforms)).

## Build instructions

### Raspberry Pi Pico

Requires the Pico toolchain https://github.com/ndabas/pico-setup-windows to be installed.

Pico-SDK version 1.3.0 is required


The following steps will build for Raspberry Pi Pico.

 1. Install cmake 3.19.x, python, Visual Studio 2019 community (must select C++), GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for window.
 2. Launch the *Developer Command Prompt for VS*
```sh
set PICO_SDK_PATH=[path to pico-sdk]
set PICO_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=[path to GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\\10 2020-q4-major\\bin]
cd EveApps
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=RP2040 -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=[EVE graphics] ..
nmake [Project name]

# [EVE graphics] can be EVE or module name, such as BT817, BT815, VM800B35A_BK ...
# [Project name] is the folder name of a subfolder inside DemoApps or SampleApp
```

Example: 
```
$ cmake.exe -G "NMake Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=RP2040 -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=BT817 -DEVE_APPS_DISPLAY=WXGA ..
$ nmake 
```

Display resolution is set via `EVE_APPS_DISPLAY`, example: cmake -G "NMake Makefiles"  -DEVE_APPS_DISPLAY=WXGA
By default, WVGA is set

EVE graphics is set via `EVE_APPS_GRAPHICS`, example: cmake -G "NMake Makefiles"  -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=BT815
By default, MULTI is set

#### Connections

| RP2040 | EVE | UART | SD |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GP0 (TX) | | RX (debug) | |
| GP1 (RX) | | TX (optional) | |
| GP2 (SPI0 SCK) | SCK | | |
| GP3 (SPI0 MOSI) | MOSI | | |
| GP4 (SPI0 MISO) | MISO | | |
| GP5 (GPIO) | CS | | |
| GP6 (GPIO) | INT | | |
| GP7 (GPIO) | PWD | | |
| 5V | 5V | | |
| GND | GND | | |

### Emulator, FT4222 and MPSSE
Way 1: Open EveApps_Emulator.sln or EveApps_MSVC.sln, press F5 to build and run

Way 2: Use Cmake: (Need Cmake 3.19)
```sh
#Launch the Developer Command Prompt for VS
cd X:\source\EveApps
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=FT4222 -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=[EVE graphics] ..
nmake [Project name]

# EVE_APPS_PLATFORM can be BT8XXEMU_PLATFORM, FT4222 of MPSSE
# [EVE graphics] can be EVE or module name, such as BT817, BT815, VM800B35A_BK ...
# [Project name] is the folder name of a subfolder inside DemoApps or SampleApp
```

example: 
```
$ cmake.exe -G "NMake Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=FT4222 -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=BT817 -DEVE_APPS_DISPLAY=WXGA ..
$ nmake 
```

### FT9XX (FT93X and FT90X)
Way 1: Import FT9XX's project inside foler "FT9XX" of any project into FT9XX toolchain. Build and run using GUI.

Way 2: Use Cmake:

```sh
cd X:\source\EveApps
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=[FT9XX module name] -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=[EVE graphics] "-DFT9XX_TOOLCHAIN=C:\Program Files (x86)\Bridgetek\FT9xx Toolchain" ..
cmake --build ./ --target [Project name]

# [EVE graphics] can be EVE or module name, such as BT817, BT815, VM800B35A_BK ...
# [FT9XX module name] can be MM900EV3A, MM930LITE ... etc
# [Project name] is the folder name of a subfolder inside DemoApps or SampleApp
```

example:
```
$ cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=MM900EV3A -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=BT817 "-DFT9XX_TOOLCHAIN=C:\Program Files (x86)\Bridgetek\FT9xx Toolchain" ..
$ cmake --build ./ 
```

## Style guide

Brief overview of symbol naming styles used.

### EVE Hal

Functions and local variables inside functions are in camelCase, for example `copyToBuffer`.

Public variables inside structures, and other global variables, are in PascalCase, for example `WriteIndex`.

Global functions, and functions used across C files within the libray, are **prefixed** with the namespace in all-caps, and the filename, class or other identifying module in PascalCase, for example `EVE_CoCmd_`. A global function will end up as `EVE_CoCmd_copyToBuffer`, a global variable will end up as `EVE_CoCmd_WriteIndex`, this helps in disambiguating variable and function names. Global functions and variables that are globally applicable may simply be prefixed with `EVE_`, for example `EVE_initialize`.

Static functions (used within a single file) don't need a prefix, just the bare name. Static variables should have an `s_` prefix for clarity, but should be avoided where possible.

Structure names are in PascalCase and preceeded by the `EVE_` prefix, for example `EVE_ConfigParameters`.

### BT8XXEMU C interface

Follows the same style as EVE Hal.

### App code

Application code generally omits any namespace prefix, since it's not necessary. Varies between apps.

### Legacy Hal

Older code, preceeded by either a `FT_` or `Ft_` prefix, uses a mixture of PascalCase and Upper_Snake_Case.
