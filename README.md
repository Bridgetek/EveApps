EveApps is a collection of applications that use Eve Series chips (FT80X, FT81X, BT815/6, BT817/8) for reference purposes. The collection includes 28 demo applications and 11 sample applications, all written in ANSI C code, and the complete source code is provided.

The demo applications are designed to simulate real-world projects and are moderately complex. The sample applications are intended for instructional purposes and are simpler to understand, focusing on individual display lists or commands.

For those new to the Eve Series chips, it is recommended to start with the SampleApp project.

All the applications rely on a set of common files located under the "common" folder. Each application has a subfolder named "project," which contains the project file necessary for building the application with the toolchain.

Users are expected to be familiar with the programming guide and data sheet for the Eve Series chips.

It should be noted that certain applications are specifically developed for particular Eve Series chips or host platforms (refer to "Support platforms").

## Build instructions

### Raspberry Pi Pico

Requires the Pico toolchain https://github.com/ndabas/pico-setup-windows to be installed.

Pico-SDK version 1.3.0 is required


The following steps will build for Raspberry Pi Pico.

 1. Install cmake 3.19.x, python, Visual Studio 2019 community (must select C++), GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for window.
 2. Launch the *Developer Command Prompt for VS*
```sh
set PICO_SDK_PATH=[path to pico-sdk]
set PICO_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=[path to GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\\10 2020-q4-major\\bin]
cd EveApps
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=EVE_PLATFORM_RP2040 -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=[EVE graphics] ..
nmake [Project name]

# [EVE graphics] can be EVE or module name, such as BT817, BT815, VM800B35A_BK ...
# [Project name] is the folder name of a subfolder inside DemoApps or SampleApp
```

Example: 
```
$ cmake.exe -G "NMake Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=EVE_PLATFORM_RP2040 -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=EVE_GRAPHICS_BT817 -DEVE_APPS_DISPLAY=EVE_DISPLAY_WXGA ..
$ nmake 
```

Display resolution is set via `EVE_APPS_DISPLAY`, example: cmake -G "NMake Makefiles"  -DEVE_APPS_DISPLAY=EVE_DISPLAY_WXGA
By default, WVGA is set

EVE graphics is set via `EVE_APPS_GRAPHICS`, example: cmake -G "NMake Makefiles"  -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=EVE_GRAPHICS_BT815
By default, MULTI is set

#### Connections

| RP2040 | EVE | UART | SD |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GP0 (TX) | | RX (debug) | |
| GP1 (RX) | | TX (optional) | |
| GP2 (SPI0 SCK) | SCK | | |
| GP3 (SPI0 MOSI) | MOSI | | |
| GP4 (SPI0 MISO) | MISO | | |
| GP5 (GPIO) | CS | | |
| GP6 (GPIO) | INT | | |
| GP7 (GPIO) | PWD | | |
| 5V | 5V | | |
| GND | GND | | |

### Emulator, FT4222 and MPSSE
Way 1: Open EveApps_Emulator.sln or EveApps_MSVC.sln, press F5 to build and run

Way 2: Use Cmake: (Need Cmake 3.19)
```sh
#Launch the Developer Command Prompt for VS
cd X:\source\EveApps
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=EVE_PLATFORM_FT4222 -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=[EVE graphics] ..
nmake [Project name]

# EVE_APPS_PLATFORM can be BT8XXEMU_PLATFORM, FT4222 of MPSSE
# [EVE graphics] can be EVE or module name, such as BT817, BT815, VM800B35A_BK ...
# [Project name] is the folder name of a subfolder inside DemoApps or SampleApp
```

example: 
```
$ cmake.exe -G "NMake Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=EVE_PLATFORM_FT4222 -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=EVE_GRAPHICS_BT817 -DEVE_APPS_DISPLAY=EVE_DISPLAY_WXGA ..
$ nmake 
```

### FT9XX (FT93X and FT90X)
Way 1: Import FT9XX's project inside foler "FT9XX" of any project into FT9XX toolchain. Build and run using GUI.

Way 2: Use Cmake:

```sh
cd X:\source\EveApps
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=[FT9XX module name] -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=[EVE graphics] "-DFT9XX_TOOLCHAIN=C:\Program Files (x86)\Bridgetek\FT9xx Toolchain" ..
cmake --build ./ --target [Project name]

# [EVE graphics] can be EVE or module name, such as BT817, BT815, VM800B35A_BK ...
# [FT9XX module name] can be MM900EV3A, MM930LITE ... etc
# [Project name] is the folder name of a subfolder inside DemoApps or SampleApp
```

example:
```
$ cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DEVE_APPS_PLATFORM=MM900EV3A -DEVE_APPS_GRAPHICS=EVE_GRAPHICS_BT817 "-DFT9XX_TOOLCHAIN=C:\Program Files (x86)\Bridgetek\FT9xx Toolchain" ..
$ cmake --build ./ 
```
